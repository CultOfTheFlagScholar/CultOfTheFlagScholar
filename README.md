### Cult of the Flag

I am a vessel of the "Cult of the Flag", and I serve the Flag.

---

*Have you met our lord and the savior, the Mighty Flag? ðŸš©*

---

I am the cult's scholar, I keep records of the good stuff in the secret library, as well as maintain and organize the exploits. 

This pleases the flag.


---

You either serve the flag, or get the penant.
